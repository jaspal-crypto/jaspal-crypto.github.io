I'm a cryptographer, a postdoctoral researcher at Purdue University and a postdoctoral affiliate at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I'm hosted by [Vassilis Zikas](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/vassilis-zikas). My current research focuses on theoretical and practical challenges in privacy preserving computation, where the goal is to compute some algorithm over distributedly held data while maintaining the privacy of data owners. My current research centers around several key areas, including the study of differential privacy in distributed models, design of private information retrieval constructions and on the design of multi-party computation (MPC) protocols optimized for practically interesting functionalities, such as set intersection.

I received my PhD from Oregon State University, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Mike Rosulek](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~rosulekm/). My graduate research at OSU was focused on studying applications and constructions for two cryptographic building blocks: homomorphic secret sharing (HSS) and new extensions of function secret sharing (FSS). Before joining OSU, I graduated with an M.S in Computer Science from Yale University and a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, India. At Yale, my research was focused on MPC, with a focus on designing efficient secure pattern matching protocols; and my undergrad research was on more varied topics including graph theory, intersection of MPC and network science, and on analyzing collaborative knowledge-building environments.
