I'm a cryptographer, a postdoctoral researcher at Purdue University and a postdoctoral affiliate at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I'm hosted by [Vassilis Zikas](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/vassilis-zikas). My current research addresses both theoretical and practical challenges in privacy-preserving computation, where the goal is to enable secure computation across distributed data while safeguarding the privacy of data owners. Specifically, my work explores several key areas including: the application of differential privacy in distributed models, the design of private information retrieval (PIR) protocols, and the design of multi-party computation (MPC) protocols tailored for practical functionalities, such as set intersection.

I received my PhD from Oregon State University, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Mike Rosulek](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~rosulekm/). My graduate research at OSU was focused on studying applications and constructions for two cryptographic building blocks: homomorphic secret sharing (HSS) and new extensions of function secret sharing (FSS). Before joining OSU, I graduated with an M.S in Computer Science from Yale University and a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, India. At Yale, my research was focused on MPC, with a focus on designing efficient secure pattern matching protocols; and my undergrad research was on more varied topics including graph theory, intersection of MPC and network science, and on analyzing collaborative knowledge-building environments.
