I'm a cryptographer, a postdoctoral researcher at Purdue University and a postdoctoral affiliate at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I'm hosted by [Vassilis Zikas](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/vzikas/). My research is focused on both theoretical and practical problems in the domain of Secure Multi-party Computation - which informally speaking, allow distrusting parties to compute on their joint data, while ensuring each party's data stays private.   

I received my PhD from Oregon State University, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Mike Rosulek](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~rosulekm/). My graduate research at OSU was focused on studying applications and constructions for homomorphic secret sharing (HSS) and new extensions of function secret sharing (FSS), which are useful building blocks for other more complex cryptographic protocols. 

Before joining OSU, I graduated with an M.S in Computer Science from Yale University and a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, India. At Yale my research was focused on MPC, with a focus on designing efficient secure pattern matching protocols; and my undergrad research was on more varied topics including graph theory, intersection of MPC and network science, and on analyzing collaborative knowledge-building environments.
